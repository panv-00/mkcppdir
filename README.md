# mkcppdir


mkcppdir is a bash script that creates a basic cpp project directory, ready to be compiled with make.


Usage:

    mkcppdir -n name -c class1 -c class2 ... -h header1 -h header2 ...

        - name    => project & main cpp file name.
        - classes => .cpp and .h class files.
        - headers => only .h header class files.


mkcpd is a simple cleaner bash script that creates a basic `C` project directory, ready to be compiled with make.


Usage:

    mkcpd  project_name  module_1 module_2 ...

        - project_name    => project & main C file name.
        - modules         => pairs of .c and .h files, automatically included
